## About Todo SDK

This application includes the basic todo functionality with crud methods. Where I've used:

- Composer 2.4.2
- PHP 8.1.12
- Laravel Framework 9.43.0

The front view is done with blade templating, I know a basic javascript but I don't know vue js.

To install this project:
<ul>
<li>-Download this file as a zip and extract it in htdocs in localhost.</li>
<li>-Create a database named todo and import the SQL file that appears in this zip file.</li>
<li>-Open the project file and copy .env.example as a .env file and change database information.</li>
<li>-Install composer by this command ( composer install )</li>
<li>-Generate app encryption key by the command ( php artisan key:generate )</li>
<li>-Serve the project to the local browser by - php artisan serve</li>
</ul>

Thank you in advance for evaluating my project.
